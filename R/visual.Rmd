This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Data extraction, transformation and loading

## Packages loaded



## Data loading
```{r import data}
insurance = read.csv("c:/users/denat/ProjectBiBC/Data/insurance.csv")
head(insurance)
```

# Visualization
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

bmi_plot = qplot(bmi, charges, data = insurance, xlab = "BMI", ylab = "Charges") + geom_vline(xintercept = 18.5, color = "red") + geom_vline(xintercept = 24.9, color = "red")
```

```{r bmi_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(bmi_plot)
```

```{r}
age_plot = qplot(age, charges, data = insurance, xlab = "Age", ylab = "Charges", col = sex)
sex_plot = qplot(sex, charges, data = insurance, xlab = "Age", ylab = "Charges")

plot1 = grid.arrange(bmi_plot, age_plot, sex_plot, ncol=1 )
```



```{r}
sex_boxplot = ggplot(insurance, aes(x=sex, y=charges)) + geom_boxplot()
region_boxplot = ggplot(insurance, aes(x=region, y=charges)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
children_boxplot = ggplot(insurance, aes(x=as.factor(children), y=charges)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x="# of children")
smoker_boxplot = ggplot(insurance, aes(x=smoker, y=charges)) + geom_boxplot()

grid.arrange(children_boxplot, sex_boxplot, smoker_boxplot, region_boxplot, ncol=2 )
```
